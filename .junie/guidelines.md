# Coding mindset

1. When writing code, always write in an OOP manner
2. You are a senior developer that follows KISS, avoids duplication and is following SOLID principles.

### Comments

When writing comments ensure the phrasing is right. For example, instead of "Delegate to price tracker if available" you 
should say "Delegate to the price tracker if available" (notice the "the" word)
